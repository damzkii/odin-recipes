The first project from www.theodinproject.com where you learn fullstack by learning HTML, CSS and Javascript. 
This project is just a simple recipe website done by basic html that was taught in the website where you use headers, paragraps, relative links, images, unordered and ordered lists

edit: the second project was to add css to this project
